                  <p1>The main core feature that EcoTemp offers is it's built with a temperature-sensing feature. This basically allows it to monitor the temperature of the whole house and decide whether to heat or cool. And, it also uses a range given by the user to determine when exactly it performs this key feature. </p1>

              <td><h1> Saves Energy</h1></td>
          </tr>
          <td colspan=2> <p1>Since the EcoTemp is programmed with a temperature sensing feature, it allows the user to set a certain range for the EcoTemp and it will either heat or cool. For example, we set the EcoTemp to cool if the temperature is higher than 23 degrees, turn off when the temperature is at 22 degrees, and heat if the temperature is under 21. This feature promotes saving energy as most old furnaces do not have the ability to stop at a given temperature. But this prevents the furnace from continuously running and damaging it. Save the trouble by accidentally forgetting to turn off the furnace, and consider buying an EcoTemp!(EcOTemp App Required to set Temperature Range.)

          <td colspan=2> <p1>Another amazing benefit EcoTemp includes is the time-saving feature. With the EcoTemp, you won't need to constantly monitor and change the temperature manually. Avoid the hassle of switching the temperature system on/off and watch the temperature-sensing ability guarantee you are receiving the heating and cooling you deserve. Let EcoTemp take care of that for you, and enjoy the new-found spare time!
