                     <h3> Computer use has become integral to daily life, yet it also has a significant environmental impact. The production, use, and disposal of computers contribute to the growing issue of electronic waste (e-waste), which poses a major environmental concern. By reducing energy consumption, enhancing recycling programs, and implementing sustainable practices, we can take essential steps to mitigate the negative environmental effects of computer use.</h3>
